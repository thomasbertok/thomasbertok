### Hi, Thomas here! 👋

I'm a Frontend Developer with over a decade of experience in the world of web development.
I've had the privilege of working with a wide range of technologies and frameworks.

🚀 My primary focus lies in crafting user interfaces using _JavaScript_, _React_, _VueJS_, _HTML_, and _CSS_, where I thrive in creating seamless, user-friendly, mobile responsive web applications.

👯 In addition to my frontend skills, I've had the opportunity working with frameworks like _Laravel_ or _Symfony_, which has provided me with a well-rounded perspective on web application development.

🔭 When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy tinkering with my homelab and extend its hardware capabilities. I like to experiment with projects on Raspberry Pi hardware making it beep boop with Python and all that's Linux. Yeah, and I make music sometimes.

🌟 Here you can find some of the projects I'm working on, always learning new technologies, putting it together bit by bit.
